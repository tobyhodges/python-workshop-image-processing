The online documentation is extremely comprehensive, and I encourage you to check it out. In addition, if you are doing a lot of data handling as well as plotting, you should check out the [`pandas`](http://pandas.pydata.org) library, for data analysis in Python. As well as providing shortcuts to create common plot types from datasets in a few lines (raw text file -> boxplot in three lines!), `pandas` allows sophisticated data filtering, summarising, and processing techniques."
