## README Pre-Tutorial on Image Processing and Analysis with Python


### Description
Here you will find a notebook containing introductory notes. It also has a short tutorial on the `numpy` library and arrays.

This course assumes a basic knowledge of the Python Programming Language.


### Requirements
- Python 2.7 and Jupyter (we recommend the Anaconda distribution, which includes most of the required modules)
- Modules: numpy, scipy, matplotlib, scikit-image, tifffile
- A text/code editor 


### Programming Concepts & Content Discussed in this Section
- Jupyter
- matplotlib
- reading data from files
- numpy
- arrays


### How to Follow this Tutorial
- Files you should have:
  - introductory-material.ipynb
  - arrays-and-numpy.ipynb
- To start the ipython notebooks, start a new terminal window and type “jupyter notebook”, then press enter. When a new browser window opens, navigate to the folder where you have saved the tutorials. Click on the tutorial that you want to follow.  
- Using Jupyter notebook: When you want to type code into a cell, simply click on it to activate it. When you want to run the code, press shift+enter. You can learn how to use Jupyter notebooks from, e.g., https://jupyter-notebook-beginner-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/
